# Bokeh 

In this part of the module you'll learn the basics of the Bokeh library. Bokeh is one of the interactive visualization libraries available for Python. With Bokeh you can quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications. 

Most of the exercises of the tutorials below are taken from the Bokeh [website](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/index.html).

## Installing Bokeh

If you use Anaconda, you can simply run the following command in your terminal:

```console
conda install bokeh
```

Alternatively, it is possible to install from PyPI using `pip`:

```console
pip install bokeh
```
