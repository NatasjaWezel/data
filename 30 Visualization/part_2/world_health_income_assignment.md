# Creating your own visualization 

In this assignment, you'll create a visualization of the development of 142 countries in the past 60 years. You'll be using the 'gapminder' dataset that contains information about the average life expectancy and gross domestic product per capita of 142 countries from 1952 - 2007. From this dataset you can derive some interesting dynamics regarding the developments in this time era regarding health and income per country.

In this assignment the aim is to visualize how wealth (GDP per capita) and health (average life expectancy) change throughout the years.

## Creating your visualization

Create your own visualization in order to answer the research question. It is important to think wisely about your design before you start coding. What would you like to show and how are you going to show this? What shapes, colors, axes will you use?

Also, make sure your visualization is interactive. Users should be able to interact with the visualization in order to get more information by, for example, hovering over your figure or being able to select what part of the dataset the user would like to see (filtering). 

Donâ€™t forget to keep an eye on code design. Use functions, choose  useful names for your variables, prevent code repetition, place comments, etc.

## Analysis

Reflect on the figure your script creates. How do you choose the range of the axes? Are all elements present  in the figure? Think about the consequences of the design choices you  make.

Important: are you able to answer your research question with the figure you've created? Why/why not? Is there something you would do different if you were going to redesign your visualization?
