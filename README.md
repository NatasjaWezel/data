# Data Processing

These course materials will familiarize you with data processing pipelines. A data pipeline is a set of actions that extracts data from various sources and enables visualisation and analysis of this data to answer a given hypothesis. Each module will emphasise a step in the data processing pipeline:
- Acquisition: This module discusses data acquisition and the different file-types/structures that you will encounter.
- Transformation: This module discusses transformations you might apply to your data to enable you to answer the hypothesis.
- Visualisation: This module discusses the methods you might use to visualise the candidate answers to your hypothesis.
- Analysis: This module discusses the methods you can use to verify the answers to your hypothesis.
