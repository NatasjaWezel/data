# Project requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should include. Functional requirements define the scope of the projects. Implementation details make sure all projects can be graded in the same way, and ensure usefulness for a broad audience.

## Functional requirements

* The project should answer a clearly defined question, or help readers answer those questions, through a bokeh serve page with an additional pdf that describes the visualization and answers the research question. Together, these documents need to tell a story. The story should be reasonably original with regards to interactive visualizations that have previously been published.
* You are invited to work on the basis of one or more data sets that you haven’t used in earlier courses, as long as these allow a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval by the course’s instructor).
* The final product must implement at the very least 3 linked interactive views showing different aspects of the data, as well as at least 2 other interactive components (e.g. table, dropdown, checkbox, etc.).
* At least one view should comprise a visualization that you have not implemented in earlier courses. At least one interactive component has to be connected to data (e.g., resulting in variable or dataset change).
* The final product embodies good visualization practices.

## Implementation details

* Your visualization must be published using a bokeh serve page. This page should be clearly formatted and standalone.
* Besides the visualization, hand in a pdf in which you describe your visualization and show the answer to your research question. 
* During the project, keep track of a logbook in which you describe your progress and challenges.
* Write your code in several python files (for data processing, visualization part etc.)
* Add a readme file that describes all files in your folder (what does every file do)
* Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.
* You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project.
* Optionally: you are also allowed to create a screencast with your visualization. In that case, you do not have to hand in a pdf with the description of your visualization. From this screencast it should be clear how your visualization works and you should also dicuss your research question.

## Submission

Hand in a zip file that includes 

1) Python files 
2) The data
3) A readme file with all information needed to run your code (what every file does, in what order to execute your code etc.)
4) Your logbook
5) Either a pdf (max. 2 pages) with your visualization description or a screencast of your visualization
