# Project requirements

Here we list the requirements that all submitted projects should accommodate. Functional requirements define the scope of the projects, and implementation details make sure all projects can be graded in the same way, and ensure usefulness to a broad audience.

## Functional requirements

* The project should answer a clearly defined question, or help readers answer those questions, through a self-explanatory notebook. The notebook needs to tell a story. The story should be reasonably original with regards to interactive visualizations that have previously been published.
* You are invited to work on the basis of one or more data sets that you haven’t used in earlier courses, as long as these allow a visualization of sufficient complexity to be created (pending approval by the course’s instructor).
* The final product must implement at the very least 3 linked interactive views showing different aspects of the data, as well as at least 2 other interactive components (e.g. table, dropdown, checkbox, etc.).
* At least one view should comprise a visualization that you have not implemented in earlier courses. At least one interactive component has to be connected to data (e.g., resulting in variable or dataset change).
* The final product embodies good visualization practices.

## Implementation details

* Your visualization must be published using a Jupyter notebook 
* Under no circumstances should we be able to cause your program to crash at runtime.
* You must include your name in a comment atop every source file in the project.
