# Project

In this project, you'll create your own visualization with a data set and research question of your choice. The project is divided in four parts, shown below. 

[Kickoff phase](/project/kickoff)
* Part 1: Proposal - Proof of concept

[Implementing your project](/project/implementation)
* Part 2: Design
* Part 3: Minimum Viable Product
* Part 4: Cleanup, Final Product 

## Schedule

Every part takes 1 week if you follow the course in 8 weeks and 2 weeks per part in case you follow the course in 16 weeks. At the end of each part, you'll discuss your progress with your TA via zoom. 

## Process book

At the start of the project, create a process book in which you keep track of your progress during the project. Note that it is not necessary to describe in detail what you have been working on every day. Just describe your most important findings and challenges during the project. At the end of the project this process book gives an insight in the progression of the project from beginning to end. 

In your process book, you simply chronicle your bigger decisions. When faced with a large decision, use your process book to document the following:

* The choice you've made
* What you expect to happen as a result of that choice
* Why you expect things to pan out that way

By doing so, you can use your process book for reflection. By documenting and priodically reviewing your decisions, you'll get a better grasp on the overall project and you might be able to identify trends or common traps you find yourself falling into.

To put it simply, a process book helps to refine your decision-making process as you move forward, rather than being something that helps you actually make a choice in the moment.

### Some tips for your process book

Below you'll find some tips you’ll want to keep in mind to really make the most of this practice. 

1. **Don't use it for everything** Your process book shouldn’t be a burdensome activity that slows down the process of making every single decision. Reserve it exclusively for the larger decisions that have potentially major consequences and require some serious thought and deliberation.
2. **Keep it simple** Use simple language, short sentences, and be as straightforward as possible when documenting your decisions. That will allow you to look back and get the information you really need—without wading through paragraphs of flowery language and unnecessary details.  
3. **Create a simple template** One of the best ways to keep things simple is to create a template that you can use time and time again. It’ll prompt you to stay focused on the need-to-know information and remove a lot of the guesswork and ambiguity from the decision journaling process. 
Here’s what this could look like:

    * Date I made this decision: 
    * The decision I made was: 
    * I believe this decision will lead to: 
    * Why I believe this decision will pan out this way: 
4. **Review your journal frequently** A process book isn’t about helping you make choices in the heat of the moment. It’s a record that you can refer back to in order to understand your blind spots and make better decisions moving forward. So, that means you need to actually look back at it—and you should plan to do so frequently.

## Scheduling meetings

If you would like to schedule a zoom meeting, send an email to your TA to make an appointment. Before every zoom meeting, email your process book to your TA (preferably some hours before the meeting).
