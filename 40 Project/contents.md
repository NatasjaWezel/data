# Project

In this project, you'll create your own visualization with a data set and research question of your choice.

The project is split into four parts:

1. Part 1: Proposal - Proof of concept
2. Part 2: Design
3. Part 3: Minimum Viable Product
4. Part 4: Cleanup, Final Product 

Every part takes 1 week if you follow data processing in 8 weeks and 2 weeks per part in case you follow data processing in 16 weeks. At the end of each part, you'll discuss your progress with your TA via zoom. 

At the start of the project, create a process book in which you keep track of your progress during the project. Note that it is not necessary to describe in detail what you have been working on every day. Just describe your most important findings and challenges during the project. At the end of the project this process book gives an insight in the progression of the project from beginning to end. 

If you would like to schedule a zoom meeting, send an email to your TA to make an appointment. Before every zoom meeting, email your process book to your TA (preferably some hours before the meeting). 

## Part 1: Proposal - proof of concept

First have a look at the [requirements](/project/requirements) of the project.

In this part you'll:

1. Acquire a data set and corresponding research question. 
2. Create a proof of concept

The first step in creating your visualization is thinking about what you would like to show. In order to do so, you'll first have to find a data set. Second, you'll have to decide on a research question that can be answered with the data you've found. Estimate the effort required to implement the project. Your project may have a high risk of failure if:

* the envisioned project tries to do too much
* the envisioned project doesn't do enough
* the purpose of the project is not well-defined (too vague)

Also think about the problem you are trying to solve, and how to capture this problem in a research question. The problem has to be clearly described and very specific. There are two possibilities here:

* There is a clearly defined problem that a reasonably large group of people have, which an app or visualization can solve particularly well.
* There is a widespread lack of knowledge or understanding that an interactive visualization is particularly suited to remedy.

The next step is to create a proof of concept. You do some explorative analysis on your data set to check if the data contains the information you need and also if you can find something interesting in the data. Are you able to find a pattern in your data that might answer your research question? 

In case you are not able to find something interesting or find out that your data, for example, is too incomplete, go back to step 1 and try to find a new data set and research question. Note that it is normal to iterate through step 1 and 2 a couple of times before you're able to find something interesing.

During this process, schedule a zoom meeting with your TA every time you have completed step 1 or step 2 of this part (whether or not succesfully). These meetings are intended to discuss your ideas, get feedback from your TA and approve your project concept. As it is expected that you will have to try several versions before you end up with a working proof of concept, make sure to schedule your first step 1 meeting as soon as possible.

## Part 2: Design and start of MVP

Based on your proof of concept, you can now start studying your problem in more detail. 

* First summarize your idea in a single sentence, connecting it to your research question.
* Create a visual sketch of what the final product will look like for the user; if you envision the application to have multiple elements, sketch these all out separately. Clearly specify the possible user interactions, and include concrete examples of data. Your sketches do not have to be professional-looking, but they have to be complete and neat! An example sketch for a data visualization:

* Create a list of main features that will be available to users. All features should also be visible in the sketch. Keep it brief.
* Split the features into 1) the minimum viable product (MVP) and 2) parts that are optional to implement.

A minimum viable product is the product with as least features as possible, which still helps solve the problem for your target audience. We think it’s important to clearly define this, because it defines the minimum amount of work that you will have to put into the project.

Other parts of your project may be optional to implement or “nice to have”.

Plan a zoom meeting to show your completed design. As soon as you have a clear design for the project, start programming your solution! 

## Part 3: Minimum Viable Product

This week, you’ll work towards finishing a MVP version of your project. Make sure that you have all your data ready this week, and that there is basic interaction, core functionality is mostly implemented. It need not be finished in terms of small bugs and code quality. 

Again, plan a zoom meeting to show off your MVP.

## Part 4: Final Product

Before submission, compare your solution to the project [requirements](/project/requirements) one last time. Also, is it still clear that your proposed project is indeed a solution to the research question? 

Code quality is also taken into account. Make sure to write your code in functions and add comments to ensure your code is well readable.

Finally, make sure that your document is spell-checked, and that images are not too large or too small.

Schedula a zoom meeting with your TA before you hand in your final version.
